### Background 
This was created in order to make searching for your favourite manga in thirdparty apps like Tachiyomi a bit easier.

### Build from source
Create a virtualenv first:
```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:
```
PS C:\Users\<user>\<PATH to venv>\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install > requirements.txt
```

Run the program:
```
python main.py
```

### Download executable
If you don't want to build from source then download the executable from releases but be sure to look into the source code to reassure yourself since you'll have to provide your username and password to the program afterall.

### Contributing
If you think this program can be improved in any way please open a PR or if you find a bug or issue open a new issue
